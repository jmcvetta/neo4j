neo4j - Neo4j client for Go
===========================

# Renamed

Package `neo4j` has been renamed [`neoism`](https://github.com/jmcvetta/neoism)
to avoid conflicting repository names with Neo4j itself.

Please update your software.  All future changes will be made to `neoism`;
package `neo4j` is deprecated.
